    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      If you're looking for something different to make at your next BBQ, give
      these Middle Eastern inspired turkey kebabs a try! A cross between a
      grilled meatball and a hamburger on a stick. You can skip the stick if you
      wish or even cook them in a skillet, but with Memorial Day around the
      corner, I thought these would be fun!
    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 pound ground turkey</li>
      <li>1 small onion, minced</li>
      <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
      <li>¼ cup chopped fresh cilantro</li>
      <li>1 egg</li>
      <li>¼ teaspoon chopped green chile pepper</li>
      <li>¼ teaspoon ground coriander</li>
      <li>¼ teaspoon ground paprika</li>
      <li>¼ teaspoon chili powder</li>
      <li>salt to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Preheat grill for medium heat and lightly oil the grate.</li>
      <li>
        Combine ground turkey, onion, garlic, cilantro, egg, chile pepper,
        coriander, paprika, chili powder, and salt together in a large bowl; mix
        thoroughly.
      </li>
      <li>
        Divide turkey mixture into twelve 1/4-cup portions, roll into log-shaped
        ovals, and place on a baking sheet.
      </li>
      <li>
        Grill ovals over indirect heat on middle rack, turning occasionally,
        until no longer pink in the center, 25 to 30 minutes. An instant-read
        thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F
        (74 degrees C).
